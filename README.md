# Xsens-IMU-Raw-Data-Squat-RDL
Raw full-body Xsens IMU data from 15 healthy adults performing squats and Romanian deadlifts. Data were recorded using a 17-sensor configuration at 60 Hz and exported directly from the Xsens software without preprocessing. Both correct and intentionally incorrect executions are included.


# Raw Xsens IMU Dataset for Squat and Romanian Deadlift Analysis

This repository contains raw inertial motion capture (IMU) data collected using an Xsens full-body system and used in the study:

**"Anthropometry and diagnostic aware deep learning for exercise assessment"**

The dataset is provided to support reproducibility and further research in biomechanical analysis, wearable sensing, and human activity recognition.
